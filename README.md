# react-universal

A `react` starter kit that, obviously, handles universal rendering as well as a bunch of another 'neat' things. Included:

1. `react`, clearly.
2. `react-router` for routing on the client and server.
3. `redux`, `redux-router`, `react-redux`, `redux-devtools`, and `redux-thunk` for state managment.
4. `koa` for the client server.
5. `express` for the `graphql` and dev server.
6. `graphql`, `graphql-relay` for building a backend.
