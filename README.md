# react-universal

A work in progress, this is my ideal setup for working with React on the client
and the server.

- react
- redux
- redux devtools
- react-router
- koa
- babel
- webpack

I recently rewrote the build process from scratch and restructured the folders,
and in doing so, I temporarily removed the following:

- postgres
- graphql

These features will be added back very soon.

Real documentation coming soon...
